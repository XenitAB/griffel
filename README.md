# Griffel

Patch Grafana dashboards efficiently.

Griffel is useful when you need to add templating variables to a large amount of Grafana dashboards.
This is necessary when metrics are sourced from multiple environments and there is a need to drill down.
Griffel is not meant to be a replacement for jsonnet or grafanalib but instead a complement, to be run as a
last step after the json has been generated.
